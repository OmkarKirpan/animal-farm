# Animal Farm - Full Stack Application

Welcome to the Animal Farm project, our full-stack application designed to showcase client-server interaction using React, Vite, Bun.js, and Express.

## Project Overview

Animal Farm is a full-stack application that emphasizes the importance of client-server interaction in web development. By implementing real-time search functionality and modern JavaScript practices, this project serves as a practical guide for building interactive and scalable web applications.

## Features

- 🐾 **First Full Stack Application**: Animal Farm serves as a foundational project for understanding the basics of full-stack development.

- 🔍 **Real-time Search Input**: Users can type in the search input to see real-time results fetched from the backend.

- ⚛️ **Frontend with React**: We use Vite to create a seamless and user-friendly development experience for the frontend.

- 🗄️ **Backend with Bun.js and Express**: The server is powered by Bun.js, with Express managing the backend operations.

- 📦 **Package Management**: Projects are initialized with npm in separate directories for the frontend and backend, ensuring organized and maintainable codebases.

- 🎨 **Minimal Boilerplate**: We start with a blank canvas in `app.jsx`, keeping the setup minimal to focus on essential features.

- 📖 **Source Code**: The complete source code is available on GitHub for reference and learning purposes.

## Key Insights

- 🌐 **Client-Server Interaction**: Understanding the flow between client and server is crucial in web development, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of applications.

- ⚙️ **Vite as a Build Tool**: Vite simplifies the setup process for React applications, making it ideal for beginners and providing a fast development environment.

- 🗂️ **Modular Approach**: Separating the frontend and backend projects leads to cleaner code management and better scalability.

- 📦 **npm for Dependency Management**: Mastering npm commands and dependency management is essential for building robust applications.

- 🔄 **Real-time Data Fetching**: Implementing dynamic search functionality showcases the importance of real-time updates and interactive user experiences.

- 💡 **Modern JavaScript**: Utilizing ECMAScript modules and modern JavaScript features promotes best coding practices.

- 📝 **Importance of Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and access to source code facilitate learning and serve as valuable resources for future projects.
